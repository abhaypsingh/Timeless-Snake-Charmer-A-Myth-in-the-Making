Chapter 8 V1

The Serpent's Transformation 

Anger once stirred, now tamedAs an herbalist draws poison from a wound,The seeker casts aside this world and the next,Shedding old skin like the serpent’s renewal.

Lust severed at the rootLike a lotus plucked from the lake’s depths,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As a serpent discards its worn-out skin.

Craving drained of its powerThe fast-flowing stream now dried up,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,As a serpent sheds its old, useless skin.

Conceit swept awayLike a flood washing away a fragile reed bridge,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As a serpent leaves behind its aged skin.

No core found in existenceAs a seeker finds no flower in the udumbara tree,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As a serpent sloughs off its outgrown skin.

Irritation transcendedBeyond the grasp of transient states,The seeker discards here and beyond,As a serpent slips free of its skin.

Thoughts burned outExcised entirely from within,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As a serpent sheds its old, worn-out skin.

Neither too far nor too closeTranscending all proliferation,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,As a serpent sheds its old, confining skin.

The world known as unrealSeeing through the veil of illusion,The seeker leaves behind here and beyond,As a serpent discards its worn-out skin.

Devoid of greedKnowing all is unreal,The seeker discards here and beyond,As a serpent sheds its old, restrictive skin.

Devoid of lustSeeing the truth of impermanence,The seeker leaves behind here and beyond,As a serpent leaves behind its aged skin.

Devoid of hatredUnderstanding the nature of illusion,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,As a serpent slips free of its old skin.

Devoid of delusionKnowing all is but a dream,The seeker sheds here and beyond,As a serpent leaves its worn-out skin behind.

Without latent tendenciesUprooted are the roots of unwholesome thoughts,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As a serpent sheds its old, limiting skin.

No distress-born statesNo longer tethered to the near shore,The seeker leaves behind here and beyond,As a serpent discards its outworn skin.

No desire-born statesFree from the chains of existence,The seeker sheds here and beyond,As a serpent sloughs off its aged skin.

Five hindrances abandonedCrossing over with clarity, free of darts,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,As a serpent sheds its old, unnecessary skin.

The Fire of Transformation

Anger once stirred, now tamedAs an herbalist draws poison from a wound,The seeker casts aside this world and the next,Like a phoenix rising from the flames, reborn.

Lust severed at the rootLike a lotus plucked from the lake’s depths,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As flames consume the old, revealing the new.

Craving drained of its powerThe fast-flowing stream now dried up,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,Like embers cooling after a fierce blaze.

Conceit swept awayLike a flood washing away a fragile reed bridge,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As fire purges the impurities, leaving pure ash.

No core found in existenceAs a seeker finds no flower in the udumbara tree,The seeker abandons here and beyond,Like smoke dissipating into the boundless sky.

Irritation transcendedBeyond the grasp of transient states,The seeker discards here and beyond,As flames transform wood into radiant light.

Thoughts burned outExcised entirely from within,The seeker abandons here and beyond,As a fire consumes all that is old and withered.

Neither too far nor too closeTranscending all proliferation,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,Like a controlled fire, burning away excess.

The world known as unrealSeeing through the veil of illusion,The seeker leaves behind here and beyond,As flames reveal the truth in their consuming dance.

Devoid of greedKnowing all is unreal,The seeker discards here and beyond,As fire purges desire, leaving only clarity.

Devoid of lustSeeing the truth of impermanence,The seeker leaves behind here and beyond,As flames engulf what no longer serves.

Devoid of hatredUnderstanding the nature of illusion,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,Like a fire that burns away darkness, revealing light.

Devoid of delusionKnowing all is but a dream,The seeker sheds here and beyond,As fire consumes the veil of ignorance.

Without latent tendenciesUprooted are the roots of unwholesome thoughts,The seeker abandons here and beyond,Like a forest renewing itself after a cleansing fire.

No distress-born statesNo longer tethered to the near shore,The seeker leaves behind here and beyond,As flames liberate, reducing all to pure essence.

No desire-born statesFree from the chains of existence,The seeker sheds here and beyond,As a fire refines gold, leaving it untainted.

Five hindrances abandonedCrossing over with clarity, free of darts,The seeker lets go of here and beyond,Like a final blaze that leaves nothing but truth in its wake.
